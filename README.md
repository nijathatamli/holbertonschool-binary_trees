## 📖 What is a Binary Tree?

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most **two children**:  
- **Left child**  
- **Right child**  

Binary Trees are widely used in:
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Compilers and parsers
- Expression evaluation
- Networking and routing
- Databases and file systems
